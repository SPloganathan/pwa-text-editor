## Description 
    
*The what, why, and how:* 
      
This project is to build a text editor that runs in the browser. The app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.
## Usage

* On opening my application in my editor then we should see a client server folder structure.
* When we run `npm run start` from the root directory
then we find that my application should start up the backend and serve the client.
* When we run the text editor application from my terminal
then we find that my JavaScript files have been bundled using webpack.
* When we run my webpack plugins then we find that we have a generated HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file.
* When we use next-gen JavaScript in my application then we find that the text editor still functions in the browser without errors.
* When we open the text editor then we find that IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage.
* When we enter content and subsequently click off of the DOM window
then we find that the content in the text editor has been saved with IndexedDB.
* When we reopen the text editor after closing it then we find that the content in the text editor has been retrieved from our IndexedDB.
* When we click on the Install button then we download my web application as an icon on my desktop.
* When we load my web application then we should have a registered service worker using workbox.
* When we register a service worker then we should have my static assets pre cached upon loading along with subsequent pages and static assets.
